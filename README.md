Pizza Sales Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to gain valuable business insights and optimize performance. Using key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations, we aim to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and product performance.

Key KPIs:
Total Revenue: Sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
Average Order Value: Revenue per order, calculated by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders.
Total Pizzas Sold: Sum of all pizzas sold across orders.
Total Orders: Number of orders placed.
Average Pizzas Per Order: Average pizzas per order, calculated by dividing total pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

Visualizations:
Daily Trend of Total Orders: Bar chart showing daily fluctuations in order volume.
Hourly Trend of Total Orders: Line chart illustrating order volume by hour of the day.
Sales by Pizza Category: Pie chart displaying percentage distribution of sales by pizza categories.
Sales by Pizza Size: Pie chart showing sales distribution by pizza size.
Total Pizzas Sold by Category: Funnel chart comparing total pizzas sold by category.
Top 5 Best Sellers: Bar chart highlighting top-selling pizzas.
Bottom 5 Worst Sellers: Bar chart showcasing the least-selling pizzas.
This project leverages Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that helps identify trends, optimize sales strategies, and improve overall business performance.
